   *Description: Determine if you need to maintain a history of equipment usage, maintenance records, and lifecycle data.*

4. **How will you handle relationships between resources and tasks?**  
   *Description: Define how resources are allocated to tasks, whether they can be shared, and how scheduling conflicts are resolved.*

5. **What resource utilization metrics need to be queryable?**  
   *Description: Identify metrics like utilization rate, downtime, or efficiency that need to be calculated from the data.*

## MongoDB (Document Storage) Questions

1. **What types of files will be attached to tasks?**  
   *Description: Identify the document formats, typical sizes, and special handling requirements for attached files.*

2. **Will you need to extract and index metadata from attachments?**  
   *Description: Determine if you need to parse documents for metadata (author, creation date, keywords) to make them searchable.*

3. **How will version control for documents be implemented?**  
   *Description: Decide whether you need to track document versions and how historical versions will be stored and accessed.*

4. **Will you need to query by document content or just by metadata?**  
   *Description: Consider whether full-text search within documents is required or if searching by metadata (filename, type, date) is sufficient.*

5. **How will document access control be handled?**  
   *Description: Determine if document permissions are inherited from the associated task or if they need separate access control.*

6. **Will you need to store document relationships?**
